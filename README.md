## Description
An auction site where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items that other users put up for auction. Created with bootstrap, SCSS and javaScript.

## Assignment brief
An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

## Project's goal
To use the skills from the three past semesters to create a front-end application for an auction website.

## To do
+ Add display of the users listings on profile page
+ Add display of listings that the user have bid on on profile page
+ Add display of listings the user have won on profile page

## Issues
+ The switch that shows the latest bids has some issues in firefox when refreshing page (if the switch is on it stays on, but the listings does not). Works fine in safari.
